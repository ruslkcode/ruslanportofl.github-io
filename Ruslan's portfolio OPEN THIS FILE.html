       My name is Ruslan, and I am 18 years old. <br>
      This year I started studying at Twente Pathway College in the Netherlands. <br>
      It was my first experience in Europe and also my first time living independently. <br>
      Below, I will share with you the two main soft skills that I developed during this time and also where I still have room to improve.

      <p id="sec2text" class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto p-6 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-xl text-xl">
  At the beginning of the first tem, I struggled with trusting my teammates. I had some doubts about their abilities, and this made me to take more work than I could. Instead of spreading tasks, I tried to do everything myself. The main thought I had is that I could do everything much faster and I knew my progress to submit all tasks on time. However, soon I realized that it was a huge mistake. I was wrong about speed of work and qualitive of work done by me. I not only done everything slower than it supposed to be, but moreover, I made many mistakes in structures of presentations and so on.

  But on the one of group meetings, I noticed that atmosphere there was so stresfull, and it became clear that my team wasn’t engaged in the project as much as I was. I took a step back and realized that the issue wasn’t just my teammates' lack of effort, it was also my failure that I didn't communicate ewith teammates properly.

  I decided to tell to my team about or progress and how we could work more efficient. I apologized for not trusting them and doing everything alone. Exactly from this point, we started discussing our plans and dividing work load in efficient way. I became more confident in my ability to collaborate and trust my teammates, and as a result, our work improved significantly.

  By the end of the term, I've learned the importance of communication, trusting and shared responsibility in a team. I realized that a successful result at project depends not on the one person who is carrying most of work, but on everyone contributing equally and respecting each other's strengths.

    <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      In the second term, as I was afraid about, happend a conflict in our team. The main porblem was that one member did almost all the work himself and started showing aggression. I think, he had same problem as I in the first term. But in that situation he strated being aggresive and rude to other teammember, including me. I was shocked that this person really did everything himself. I realized that if right now, we don't solve this issue, the whole project work won't happen in a good mood with respect to each other.

      So, I started acting, I broke up the ice and acted as a mediator. I acknowledged mistakes on both sides — his for taking on everything silently, and the rest of the team for being passive. I proposed a new plan with evenly divided work load and we gave an oath that if you mention that somebody doesn't work properly or doesn't do his wok, we just arrange a groop meeting and disscus this problem. But the main goal was, to do it without any negative purposes..

      As a result, this conflict was resolved, the project was completed successfully, and we became so close teammates, we spent many time together, excluding studing time. On the final presentation, we took many selfies with each other and our favourite teachers. After successfull end of project, we met at the cafe and celebrated it.

      At the end of second term, I realized, how crucial such soft skill as a conflict management at working in a team and I am pleased to my teammates, because without them I would never experienced any similar emotions.
